<h1>Breaking news<h1>
<p> Mexico have just launched nuclear explosives in the centre of America after Donald Trump kidnapped and tortured 
<p> the Queen and threatened to murder 35,000 civilians in Las Vegas. The whole of Britain army and police officers are
<p> Travelling to LA and California to murder innocent people for retribution. 
<p> That is how valuable the Queen is, if someone even layed a finger on her they will have their legs cut off.
<p> Donald Trump is now hiding somewhere in the East of America, reports subject that it's somewhere in a secret bunker.
<p> It will be difficult finding him as he has a whole armed army with him. But when we do get him, he will have a 
<p> massive punishment and will wish he never lived. 
<p> date of kidnapping - 16/8/15  time of kidnapping - 14:30  Time queen was found - 20:45    
<p> officially six hours and fifteen minutes later the Queen was found bleeding in the walmart staff room.
<p> we figured that if we were two hours late to rescuing her then she would've died. We found her face covered
<p> in blood (possibly due to the punching) and her legs were cut up. She was lucky to live and we were surprised
<p> to see her concious as she is very old. This was disgusting behaviour from Donald and the whole of America and
<p> Britain are on the hunt.
